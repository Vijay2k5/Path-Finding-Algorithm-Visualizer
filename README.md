## Project Description

-- This project is an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms solve a maze.
-- Users can create custom grids, place walls, set start and target points, and watch algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A* explore the maze in real time.
-- The system highlights the visited nodes, final path, and key performance metrics such as time taken, path length, and number of iterations.
-- It is designed to help users understand and compare algorithm behavior through visual learning and experimentation.
